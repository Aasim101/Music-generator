This code implements a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model to generate music based on MIDI files, main components and workflow:

1. Data Preparation:
   - The script reads MIDI files from a specified directory.
   - MIDI notes are extracted and encoded into a format suitable for the model (pitch and duration).
   - The encoded notes are normalized and split into sequences for training.

2. Model Architecture:
   - An RNN model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) layers is defined.
   - The model takes sequences of notes as input and predicts the next note.

3. Training:
   - The model is trained using the prepared sequences.
   - Adam optimizer and Mean Squared Error loss are used.
   - Training progress is printed every 10 epochs.

4. Music Generation:
   - After training, the model generates new music sequences.
   - It starts with a seed sequence and predicts subsequent notes.
   - The generated sequence is denormalized to recover actual pitch and duration values.

5. Output:
   - The generated music sequence is converted back to MIDI format.
   - The result is saved as 'generated_music.mid'.
